# Getting Started

Welcome to the Sticker.ly API Wrapper! This is a public HTTP API that lets you search, discover, and integrate Sticker.ly stickers, packs, tags, and artists into your own apps or tools.

## How It Works

You can access the API using any HTTP client (like curl, Postman, or fetch in JavaScript). No authentication is required.

## Example: Search for Stickers

### Using curl
```sh
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/stickers/search?q=funny+cats"
```

### Using JavaScript (fetch)
```js
fetch('https://your-domain.com/api/v1/stickers/search?q=funny cats')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual deployment URL if self-hosted.

## Available Endpoints

- Stickers: `/api/v1/stickers/*`
- Packs: `/api/v1/packs/*`
- Tags: `/api/v1/tags/*`
- Artists: `/api/v1/artists/*`
- Home Tabs: `/api/v1/home-tabs/*`

See the [API Endpoints](/endpoints) section for full details and parameters for each endpoint.
